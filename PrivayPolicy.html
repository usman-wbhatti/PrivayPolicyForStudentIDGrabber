  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    The <strong>Student ID Grabber</strong> extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    All data processing (extracting Student IDs and email addresses from the currently open page)
    happens locally on your computer. No information is ever sent to external servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only time data leaves the page is when <em>you</em> explicitly copy it to your clipboard
    by clicking the “Copy” button in the extension popup.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not collect analytics, we do not use cookies, and we do not share data with any third parties.
